Web MIDI API - Cordova Plugin Polyfill for iOS
====================
## Installation

Execute from the projects root folder:

    $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-webmidi

This is a shim to enable [Web MIDI API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/) on iOS. [WebMIDIAPIPolyfill.js](WebMIDIAPIPolyfill/WebMIDIAPIPolyfill.js) is the bridge script to invoke iOS native Core MIDI APIs. And [WebViewDelegate.m](WebMIDIAPIPolyfill/WebViewDelegate.m) is the receptor for informal URL schemes triggered by the bridge script. You can build a hybrid Web MIDI application with using them.

When launching the sample application, a simple web browser will show. You can run Web MIDI applications using the browser as if iOS WebKit had a native API support.
